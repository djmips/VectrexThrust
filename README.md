# VectrexThrust Analog mod
A port of the game "Thrust" to the Vectrex console.

It was released on cartridge in 2005 and can still be ordered from here: http://www.packratvg.com/vthrust.html

The analog mod is a WIP to modify the controls to use the stick for analog thrust control.
Some button remapping is used accomodate the Lunar Lander controller buttons 
The mod does not require a Lunar Lander controller.

A branch with Lunar Lander controller specific changes will happen later.
